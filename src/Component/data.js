She is a Senior Faculty of the same Department where she mentors both graduate and undergraduate students in neurobiology. Her passion for knowledge acquisition and impartation drove her to Neuroscience. She had her postdoctoral training at the US FDA, National Centre Toxicological Research NCTR, Jefferson Arkansas in the Division of Neurotoxicology. Orish Chinna has been involved in several neuro-skill acquisition trainings at national, continental and international levels. Her research thrust is on the preclinical mechanistic considerations of beneficial role natural antidotes on environmental toxicants induced neurodegenerative diseases. ",

Primary research thrust is in Comparative Adult Neurogenesis and gliogenesis in various mammalian and avian species. Past Secretary General/CEO, Society of Neuroscientists of Africa (SONA; 2017-2021) and now, Chair Governing Council (SONA) till 2023. Prof Ihunwo is a Councillor, representing Africa on the Council of the International Society for Neurochemistry (ISN) 2021 - 2025. PROFESSOR Ihunwo was the Principal Investigator under the prestigious Switzerland-South Africa Joint Research Programme (SSAJRP) from 2009-2014. This research provided empirical database of active and potential neurogenic sites in adult mammalian brains. The investigation focused first on South African mammalian species and then species from tropical rain forest and desert environments; for species-specific proliferation rate and time course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis during lifetime..",
