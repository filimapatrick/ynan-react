Prof Ihunwo is a Councillor, representing Africa on the Council of the International Society for Neurochemistry (ISN) 2021 - 2025. PROFESSOR Ihunwo was the Principal Investigator under the prestigious Switzerland-South Africa Joint Research Programme (SSAJRP) from 2009-2014. This research provided empirical database of active and potential neurogenic sites in adult mammalian brains. The investigation focused first on South African mammalian species and then species from tropical rain forest and desert environments; for species-specific proliferation rate and time course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis during lifetime..",
